# Peakamp Redesign

This repository hosts the code and design for a redesigned version of the Peakamp website. The project was developed as part of my application for the Frontend Intern position at Peakamp to demonstrate my skills in React, UI/UX design, and web performance optimization.

## Overview

The website redesign was completed over a weekend with several key improvements:

- **Enhanced UI & UX:**  
  A clearer visual hierarchy and a refreshed design for better navigation and overall user experience.

- **Improved Accessibility:**  
  Design updates to ensure the website is accessible to all users.

- **Optimized Performance:**  
  Significant improvements in mobile load times, as validated by Google Lighthouse analytics.

- **Opportunities for Further Optimization:**  
  Although major improvements have been made, there is still room to optimize images, SEO, and reduce the total website size.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building interactive and modular UI components.
- **Modern CSS/HTML:** To achieve a sleek, responsive, and accessible design.
- **Performance Tools:** Utilized Google Lighthouse for measuring and guiding performance improvements.
